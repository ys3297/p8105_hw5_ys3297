Solution to HW5.

## Problem 1

Load the homicide data.

``` r
homicide_raw = read_csv("./homicide-data.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

There are 52179 observations and 12 variables in the raw data. The data
included the location of the killing, whether an arrest was made and, in
most cases, basic demographic information about each victim. Each
observation is a record of a criminal homicide in the past decade in 50
of the largest American cities.

Create `city_state` and `resolved` variables and keep them only in the
resulting dataframe. Drop the data for Tulsa, AL, because there is only
1 homicide record from this city.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  homicide_raw %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL")
```

Summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the
number of unsolved homicides.

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the `prop.test` function to estimate
the proportion of homicides that are unsolved, save the output as an R
object, apply `broom::tidy` to this object, and pull the estimated
proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting tidy dataframe.

``` r
bal_results_df = 
  prop.test(
    aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
    aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% pull(hom_total)
  ) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

Now run `prop.test` for each of the cities in `aggregate_df`, and
extract both the proportion of unsolved homicides and the confidence
interval for each. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of
`purrr::map`, `purrr::map2`, list columns and `unnest` as necessary to
create a tidy dataframe with estimated proportions and CIs for each
city.

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

Create a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city, using
`geom_errorbar` to add error bars based on the upper and lower limits.
Organize cities according to the proportion of unsolved homicides.

``` r
dist_hom_city = 
  results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(
    x = "City",
    y = "Proportion of unsolved homicides",
    title = "Estimated proportions of unsolved homicides with 95% CIs for cities"
  )

dist_hom_city
```
